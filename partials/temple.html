	Jodo Shinshu is (??????) one of the most common branches of (Japanese) Buddhism in America. The Jodo Shinshu headquarters are located in Kyoto, Japan. They have temples all around the world and one in SLC. According to their website, they meet most Sundays at 10AM. 
	</p>
 	<p> As we enter the 21st century, Jodo Shinshu Buddhism is at a crossroads in its development and expansion in the United States of America. Although Jodo Shinshu has been in the United States since 1899, we are still in the beginning stages of truly becoming a part of the larger religious landscape of this country. Through the personal sacrifice and determination of the Japanese immigrants and their descendants our temple exists today. However, we now find ourselves living in a changed environment from that of our founders. To meet these ever changing needs, we must develop a new methodology by combining the sacrifice and determination of our pioneer members with new ideas, to ensure the continuation of Jodo Shinshu in our present community.
 	</p>
 	<p>Jodo Shinshu Buddhism has much to offer in teaching us about living a spiritually awakened life, in the midst of ordinary circumstances. To follow the Nembutsu path is to live a life of gratitude for Amida Buddha's infinite wisdom and compassion. Our Temple is here to help us understand how we may express appreciation for the wondrous gift of Shinjin bestowed upon us.
 	</p>
	<p> Within these pages we will explain the methodology and functions of the temple as well as a brief summary of our history, beliefs, etiquette, etc. Our temple exists for you. Please play an active role in the life of our temple.
